<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hello, I am an incoming Ph.D. candidate at School of Informatics, Nagoya University from Oct. 2023. I cannot wait to move to Nagoya which is the third biggest city in Japan. During my Ph.D. candidate, I will be advised by [Dr. Tomoki Toda](https://sites.google.com/site/tomokitoda/).

I am now working on emotional TTS, especially based on style transfer methods. Moreover, I am considering to apply ETTS models on the interdisciplinary applications.

I graduated from [Center of Intelligent Acoustics and Immersive Communications](https://ciaic.org/), Northwestern Polytechnical University with a bachelor’s degree, advised by [Jie Chen](http://www.jie-chen.com/) (陈捷教授). Under his supervision, I mainly researched on audio-visual voice activity detection. This is also why I am enthusiastic about speech processing.

I won the Graduate School Scholarship in my master. Moreover, I have been selected as a fellow in Nagoya University during my Ph.D., and the monthly payment is 180000 JPY!

My research interest includes speech processing and speech synthesis, especially in emotional Text-to-Speech. I have published some interesting papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).

[Improving Heart Rate Range Classification Using Doppler Radar with GAN-based Data Augmentation]()

**Danyuan Yu**, Mondher Bouazizi, Tomoaki Ohtsuki

[**Project**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=zh-CN&user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ&citation_for_view=DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- A GAN-based data augmentation framework was proposed to address data imbalance in Doppler radar dataset, which can influence the HR range classification.
- Our experiments show that the Doppler radar signals generated by aWGAN-GP provide more accurate morphology in terms of root mean squared error (RMSE) and Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC). In addition, the proposed method achieves the lowest relative Fréchet inception distance (rFID), which shows a better diversity in the generated Doppler radar signals. In regard to HR range classification, the proposed method relieves the data imbalance problem and obtains better classification performance in terms of accuracy, F1-score, and recall.
